# Thermistor
Here is the code I used for displaying the data from my thermistor to a 3 digit bubble display. I originally found the code for the thermistor online, then added the part for the bubble display.
I currently have it set to display in Celcius, as I am in Canada. If you would like to see the temperature in Farenheit, you can uncomment the line of code for the conversion.
I hope you enjoy!
